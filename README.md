Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

Description:
This project implements a credit card fraud detection system using logistic regression, 
aiming to identify fraudulent transactions within credit card data. 
The project utilizes Python programming language along with various 
technical libraries including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

Technical Approach:

Data Loading and Exploration: Initially, the credit card data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. 
Exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is examined for missing values and class imbalance. 
Imbalanced classes are addressed through under-sampling, ensuring a similar distribution of normal and fraudulent transactions.

Feature Engineering: Features and target labels are separated for training the model. 
The data is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation.

Model Training: Logistic regression is employed as the classification algorithm. 
The model is trained using the training data, leveraging the logistic regression implementation from the scikit-learn library.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using accuracy metrics. 
Both training and testing data are used to assess the model's predictive capability.

Technical Libraries Used:

NumPy: For numerical computing and array operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Outcome:
The logistic regression model demonstrates effectiveness in detecting credit card fraud, achieving a notable accuracy score on both training and testing data.

Future Improvements:
Future iterations of this project could explore advanced machine learning algorithms, such as ensemble methods or deep learning techniques, to further enhance the detection accuracy of fraudulent transactions. Additionally, incorporating feature engineering techniques and anomaly detection methods may contribute to improving model performance.
